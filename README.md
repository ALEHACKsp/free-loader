# Cheat Loader Project
 
That's an old project of mine that i've used in the past, it was not a "paid" product but free one simply to stream free cheats from a website/host.

It's using Blackbone as injection library for manual mapping and syscalls calling.

ImGUI for GUI.
RapidJSON for Json parsing.
CURL for HTTP POST/GET.
CryptoPP for cryptographic functions such as AES encrypt/decryption.

There's no web files on this project, mainly because i lost them but should be straighfoward to implement them yourselfs.

The project will not compile as is right now, some .lib's like Blackbone should be linked and etc..

There's very simple anti-debug measures, with a web report sample aswell.

The idea of this project is not to be used as is right now but serve as an example.
